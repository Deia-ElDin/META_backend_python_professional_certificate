- GRANT: Give user access privileges
- REVOKE: Remove user access privileges

## Practical Application Example: College Database

### Database Setup (DDL)
- Create database for college

  - Departments

### Data Management (DML)
- Insert student records

### Access Control (DCL)
- Set administrator access

### Data types:
- Numeric data types such as INT, TINYINT, BIGINT, FLOAT, REAL. 
- Date and time data types such as DATE, TIME, DATETIME.

- Binary data types such as BINARY, VARBINARY. 
- Miscellaneous data types such as:
