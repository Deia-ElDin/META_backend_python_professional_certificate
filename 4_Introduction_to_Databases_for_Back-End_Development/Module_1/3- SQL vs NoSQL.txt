# SQL vs NoSQL: When to Use Each

## SQL (Relational) Databases
### Best Used When:
1. Data Structure is Fixed
   - Predefined schema
   - Structured data
   - Consistent data format

2. Complex Queries Required
   - Multiple table joins
   - Complex transactions
   - Regular reporting needs

3. ACID Compliance Needed
   - Banking systems
   - Financial applications
   - Order processing systems

### Common Use Cases:
- Traditional business applications
- Point of sale systems
- Customer relationship management (CRM)
- Enterprise resource planning (ERP)

## NoSQL Databases
### Best Used When:
1. Flexible Data Structure Needed
   - Schema-less design
   - Unstructured data
   - Frequently changing data format

2. Handling Big Data
   - Large volumes of data
   - High-velocity data ingestion
   - Various data formats

3. Rapid Scaling Required
   - Horizontal scaling needs
   - Distributed systems
   - Cloud-based applications

### Types and Use Cases:
1. Document Databases
   - Content management systems
   - User profiles
   - Game data storage

2. Key-Value Stores
   - Session management
   - Shopping carts
   - Real-time recommendations

3. Wide-Column Databases
   - Time-series data
   - Historical records
   - Large-scale analytics

4. Graph Databases
   - Social networks
   - Fraud detection
   - Recommendation engines

## Quick Decision Guide
Choose SQL if:
- Data structure is consistent
- Complex queries are needed
- Data integrity is crucial
- Transactions require ACID compliance

Choose NoSQL if:
- Rapid data growth expected
- Flexible schema needed
- Simple queries sufficient
- High scalability required
