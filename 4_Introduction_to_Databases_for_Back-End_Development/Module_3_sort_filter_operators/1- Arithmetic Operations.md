## Arithmetic Operations (SQL) â€” Examples and Results

Assumptions for computed results:

- tax = 2000 for all employees
- hours per employee: [1: 40, 2: 41, 3: 38, 4: 44]

Employee data used for calculations:

| employee_id | employee_name | salary | allowance | tax  | hours |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------ | --------- | ---- | ----- |
| 1           | Alex          | 24000  | 1000      | 2000 | 40    |
| 2           | John          | 55000  | 1000      | 2000 | 41    |
| 3           | James         | 52000  | 1000      | 2000 | 38    |
| 4           | Sam           | 24000  | 1000      | 2000 | 44    |

| `SELECT allowance / salary * 100 FROM employee;`              | [4.17%, 1.82%, 1.92%, 4.17%]                   |
| `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE allowance / salary * 100 >= 5;` | No rows                                        |
| `SELECT hours % 2 FROM employee;`                             | [0, 1, 0, 0]                                   |
| `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE hours % 2 = 0;`                 | Rows: employee_id 1 (Alex), 3 (James), 4 (Sam) |
