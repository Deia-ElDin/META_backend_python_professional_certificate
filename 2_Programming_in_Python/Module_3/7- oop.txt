        - Can have multiple superclasses

    - Encapsulation:
        - Restricts access to certain attributes and methods
        - Can have multiple subclasses
        - Can have multiple superclasses

    - Abstraction:

        - Can have multiple subclasses
        - Can have multiple superclasses
