# Git File States
1. Modified
   - Files that have been changed but not yet staged
   - Like editing a document but haven't saved it yet

2. Staged
   - Files marked for inclusion in next commit
   - It's a preparation area for your next commit
   - Like a "waiting room" before changes become permanent
   - Gives you control over WHICH changes go into your next commit
   - For git to track a file, it must be added to stagging area
   - Using 'git add'
   - Like putting photos in a basket before taking them to be developed

3. Committed
   - Files safely stored in local database
   - Using 'git commit'
   - Like taking the final snapshot and saving it permanently
