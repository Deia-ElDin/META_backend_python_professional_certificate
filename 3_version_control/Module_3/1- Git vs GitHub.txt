# Git vs GitHub - Simple Comparison

GIT
- Version Control System
- Local version control system (runs on your computer)
- Command-line tool
- Tracks changes in your code
- Free and open source
- Like a time machine for your code files

GITHUB
- Cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories
- Web-based platform with GUI (visual interface)
- Social network for code sharing
- Built on top of Git, adding extra features:
  • Project hosting
  • Team collaboration tools
  • Pull requests
  • Issue tracking
  • Documentation hosting
  • Access control

Simple Analogy:
- Git is like your local camera that takes snapshots of your code
- GitHub is like Instagram where you share those snapshots with others
