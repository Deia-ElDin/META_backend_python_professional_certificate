# Version Control 

This directory contains all materials, code, and modules for the "Version Control" course, part of the Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate.

## Course Overview
This course introduces the fundamentals of version control, a system for tracking and managing changes to code and files. Topics include the purpose and importance of version control in software development, an overview of both centralized and distributed systems, and practical skills using Git and GitHub.

Key concepts covered include creating and cloning repositories, tracking changes, and using essential Git commands such as add, commit, push, pull, branching, and merging. The course also addresses conflict resolution and the use of command-line tools for version control tasks.
